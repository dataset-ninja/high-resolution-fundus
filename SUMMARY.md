**High Resolution Fundus (HRF) Image Database** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 45 images with 90 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *vessels* and *field of view*.

Images in the High Resolution Fundus dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, the images have ***healthy***, ***diabetic retinopathy*** and ***glaucomatous*** tags. They determine the patient's diagnosis. The dataset was released in 2013 by the Pattern Recognition Lab, Germany, Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies, Germany, International Max Planck Research School for Optics and Imaging, Germany, University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic, Department of Ophthalmology, Germany, and Ophthalmology Clinic, Zlin, Czech Republic.

**High Resolution Fundus (HRF) Image Database** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 45 images with 90 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *vessels* and *field of view*.

Images in the High Resolution Fundus dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 categories: ***diabetic retinopathy*** (15 images), ***glaucomatous*** (15 images), and ***healthy*** (15 images). The dataset was released in 2013 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">GE-CZ joint research group</span>.

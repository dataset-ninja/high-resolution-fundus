**High Resolution Fundus (HRF) Image Database** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 45 images with 90 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *vessels* and *field of view*.

Images in the High Resolution Fundus dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2013 by the Pattern Recognition Lab (CS5), Department of Ophthalmology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg (Germany), and Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Comunnication, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Brno (Czech Republic).

The authors of the **High Resolution Fundus (HRF) Image Database** have a goal to create a database of fundus images with gold standards for the task of segmentation. The dataset contains 15 images of ***healthy*** patients, 15 images of patients with ***diabetic retinopathy***, and 15 images of ***glaucomatous patients***. Binary gold standard _vessel_ segmentation images are available for each. Also, the masks determining _field of view_ (FOV) are provided for particular datasets. The gold standard data is generated by a group of experts working in the field of retinal image analysis and clinicians from the cooperated ophthalmology clinics.

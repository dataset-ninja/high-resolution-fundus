This dataset has been established by a collaborative research group to support comparative studies on automatic segmentation algorithms on retinal fundus images.
Authors would like to help researchers in the evaluation of segmentation algorithms.

## Data

The public dataset contains at the moment 15 images of healthy patients, 15 images of patients with diabetic retinopathy and 15 images of glaucomatous patients. Binary gold standard vessel segmentation images are available for each image. Also the masks determining field of view (FOV) are provided for particular datasets. The gold standard data is generated by a group of experts working in the field of retinal image analysis and clinicians from the cooperated ophthalmology clinics.

The authors' goal is to create a high-resolution database, fundus images with gold standards for most species segmentation algorithms and a website where researchers can compare their segmentation methods. The dataset contains at the moment 15 images of _healthy_ patients, 15 images of patients with _diabetic retinopathy_ and 15 images of _glaucomatous patients_. Binary gold standard _vessel_ segmentation images are available for each image. Also the masks determining _field of view_ (FOV) are provided for particular datasets. The gold standard data is generated by a group of experts working in the field of retinal image analysis and clinicians from the cooperated ophthalmology clinics.
